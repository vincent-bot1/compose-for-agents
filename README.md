# Compose for Agents Demos

## Prerequisites

+ **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) 4.43.0+ or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)** installed
+ **A laptop or workstation with a GPU** (e.g., a MacBook) for running open models locally. If you don't have a GPU, you can alternatively use **Docker Offload**.
+ If you're using Docker Engine on Linux or Docker Desktop on Windows, ensure that the [Docker Model Runner requirements](https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/) are met (specifically that GPU support is enabled) and the necessary drivers are installed
+ If you're using Docker Engine on Linux, ensure you have Compose 2.38.1 or later installed

## Demos

Each of these demos is self-contained and can be run either locally or using a cloud context. They are all configured using two steps.

1. change directory to the root of the demo project
1. create a `.mcp.env` file from the `mcp.env.example` file (if it exists, otherwise the demo doesn't need any secrets) and supply the required MCP tokens
1. run `docker compose up --build`

### Using OpenAI models

The demos support using OpenAI models instead of running models locally with Docker Model Runner. To use OpenAI:
1. Create a `secret.openai-api-key` file with your OpenAI API key:

```
sk-...
```
2. Start the project with the OpenAI configuration:

```
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.openai.yaml up
```
