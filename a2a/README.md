# 🧠 A2A Multi-Agent Fact Checker

This project demonstrates a **collaborative multi-agent system** built with the **Agent2Agent SDK** ([A2A]),
where a top-level Auditor agent coordinates the workflow to verify facts. The Critic agent gathers evidence
via live internet searches using **DuckDuckGo** through the Model Context Protocol (**MCP**), while the Reviser
agent analyzes and refines the conclusion using internal reasoning alone. The system showcases how agents
with distinct roles and tools can **collaborate under orchestration**.

> [!Tip]
> ✨ No configuration needed — run it with a single command.

# 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- 🐳 [Docker Desktop] **v4.43.0+**

### Run the project


```sh
docker compose up --build
```

No configuration needed — everything runs from the container. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to and select `AgentKit` in the selector at the top right, then chat with
the agents.

Using Docker Offload with GPU support, you can run the same demo with a larger model that takes advantage of a more powerful GPU on the remote instance:
```sh
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.offload.yml up --build
```


# ❓ What Can It Do?

This system performs multi-agent fact verification, coordinated by an **Auditor**:

- 🧑‍⚖️ **Auditor**:
  - Orchestrates the process from input to verdict.
  - Delegates tasks to Critic and Reviser agents.
- 🧠 **Critic**:
	- Uses DuckDuckGo via MCP to gather real-time external evidence.
-	✍️ **Reviser**:
	- Refines and verifies the Critic’s conclusions using only reasoning.

**🧠 All agents use the Docker Model Runner for LLM-based inference.**

- The Auditor is a Sequential Agent, it coordinates Critic and Reviser agents to verify user-provided claims.
- The Critic agent performs live web searches through DuckDuckGo using an MCP-compatible gateway.
- The Reviser agent refines the Critic’s conclusions using internal reasoning alone.
- All agents run inference through a Docker-hosted Model Runner, enabling fully containerized LLM reasoning.

# 🤝 Agent Roles

| **Agent**   | **Tools Used**        | **Role Description**                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auditor** | ❌ None               | Coordinates the entire fact-checking workflow and delivers the final answer. |
| **Critic**  | ✅ DuckDuckGo via MCP | Gathers evidence to support or refute the claim                              |
| **Reviser** | ❌ None               | Refines and finalizes the answer without external input                      |


# 🧹 Cleanup

To stop and remove containers and volumes:

```sh
docker compose down -v
```
