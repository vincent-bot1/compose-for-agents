# 🧠 CrewAI Marketing Team Demo

This project showcases an autonomous, multi-agent **virtual marketing team** built with
[CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI). It automates the creation of a high-quality, end-to-end marketing strategy — from research to copywriting — using task delegation, web search, and creative synthesis.

> [!Tip]
> ✨ No configuration needed — run it with a single command.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- ✅ [Docker Desktop] **v4.43.0+**

### Run the Project

```sh
docker compose up
```

That’s all. The agents will spin up and collaborate through a series of predefined roles and tasks to
deliver a complete marketing strategy for the input project.


## ❓ What Can It Do?

Give it a company and a project description — the agents will collaborate to produce a full marketing strategy:

- “Research the market landscape around CrewAI’s automation tools.”
- “Understand the target audience for enterprise AI integrations.”
- “Formulate a high-impact marketing strategy with KPIs and channels.”
- “Propose 5 creative campaigns tailored to tech decision-makers.”
- “Write compelling ad copy for each campaign idea.”

From strategy to storytelling, the team handles it all — autonomously.

You can **customize the tasks** to use your own domain and project description — just edit the inputs in `src/config/inputs.yaml`.

- The LangGraph-based agent transforms questions into SQL.
- PostgreSQL is populated from a SQLite dump at runtime.
- All components are fully containerized for plug-and-play usage.
